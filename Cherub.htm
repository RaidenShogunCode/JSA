<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>Yesterday, Dec 22 2022, I
published my website that promotes Christian Universal Salvation. That is Jesus
Christ will save the entire world through faith alone. And everybody in
existence will become believers in Christ through faith alone thusly. I went to
sleep at around 4:00 AM </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>Today, Dec 23 2022, I just woke up
from a dream at around 10:00 AM I had about Christian Universal Salvation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>The sky was light blue and when I
looked up there were multiple giant animal heads shaped from white clouds. They
were all looking to the right halfway forward and halfway turning, so diagonal,
and looking forward, so not directly at me. I will go from left to right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>On the left there was the head of
a lion. Below its head was a verse that said ALL PEOPLE, with that part
specifically capitalized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>Most likely it was this verse: </span><span
style='color:yellow'>Titus 2:11 NRSVue For the grace of God has appeared,
bringing salvation to all </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>It was a male lion with a big fur
going around its head. It looked similar to this:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'><a
href="https://cincinnatizoo.org/system/assets/uploads/2013/07/36692305443_de5d7f7bde_b.jpg">https://cincinnatizoo.org/system/assets/uploads/2013/07/36692305443_de5d7f7bde_b.jpg</a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'><a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>Then there was another animal in
between. Next continuing right was the head of an ox. Below its head was a
verse that said ALL CREATION, whit that part specifically capitalized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>Most likely it was this verse: </span><span
style='color:yellow'>Colossians 1:15-20 NRSVue He is the image of the invisible
God, the firstborn of all creation, 16 for in[a] him all things in heaven and
on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or
dominions or rulers or powers&#8212;all things have been created through him and for
him. 17 He himself is before all things, and in[b] him all things hold
together. 18 He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the
firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in
everything. 19 For in him all the fullness of God[c] was pleased to dwell, 20
and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on
earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>It was not a furry ox, but rather
one with a smooth straight face with horns going out then curving in. It looked
similar to this:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'><a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>There was another head that I
donÅft remember, but the verse below is had something along the lines of God
created ALL VERSES</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:yellow'>2 Timothy 3:16 NRSVue All
scripture is inspired by God and is[a] useful for teaching, for reproof, for
correction, and for training in righteousness,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>I woke up agreeing with all of
these verses and I felt greatly comforted as I hugged and embraced the Lord.
Last night, despite it being late, because I was working on publishing my
Christian Universalism website, I had energy. And today, even when I wake up
early, I still have energy too and feel well rested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>Researching it now, it seems this
was a cherub or cherubim.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:yellow'>Ezekiel 10:1 NRSVue Then I
looked, and above the dome that was over the heads of the cherubim there
appeared above them something like a sapphire,[a] in form resembling a throne.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:yellow'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:yellow'>Ezekiel 1:10 NRSVue As for the
appearance of their faces: the four had the face of a human being, the face of
a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and the face of
an eagle;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:yellow'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:yellow'>Revelation 4:6-8 NRSVue and in
front of the throne there is something like a sea of glass, like crystal. Around
the throne, and on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of
eyes in front and back: 7 the first living creature like a lion, the second
living creature like an ox, the third living creature with a face like a human,
and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle. 8 And the four living
creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and inside.
Day and night without ceasing they sing, ÅgHoly, holy, holy, the Lord God the
Almighty, who was and is and is to come.Åh</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>IÅfve had those last few words on
the tip of my tongue for the past few days and now this explains why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>I have a laptop that I connected
to my Panasonic Plasma HD Tv TC-P42X1 with a Rocketfish HDMI Cable. A few days
ago, as I was editing my website with more Bible verses a few days ago before
publishing the website, I heard a sound from the Tv and saw my Tv turn a bright
red hue, like the color of blood, and all four sides started burning and
travelling towards the center. It was like a paper burning from all 4 sides,
where the burning would spread with a sort of round shape. And the whole time
it made a mechanical error noise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>I immediately unplugged my HDMI
cable on both ends and then re-plugged it in. Eventually, the screen was just
black, and when I clicked the black power button in the middle, instead of the
small circle light staying red, it would rhythmically go from red and then
nothing at a moderate pace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>Later, when I told my family
members, they didnÅft believe what I had told them, they told me I should have
videoed it on my phone. But it went by so quick, I didnÅft have time. But they
did see the Tv would not turn on, even after plugging it in and out. We had the
TV for a long time, at least 5 years minimum, so it was due for a replacement
anyways. At least we can buy it with those Christmas discounts in place lol.
But this did not stop me from uploading the site to the Internet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>Lastly, the date that I bought the
domain for the website is very significant to me for multiple personal reasons.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>The date brought me joy, then I
suffered for a year because of that date, but now the joy has returned. I wrote
the Journal Entries about discovering Christian Universal Salvation 5 years
ago, and since then I always wondered when I could put them to use, and now it
has been fulfilled. Yet another miracle. Though I greatly suffered back then, I
can now see how the recording of my suffering on this website can help others.
The Lord always finishes what He starts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:white'>IÅfm crying as I type this. Tears
of relief, joy. I am truly grateful to the Lord for showing me this vision.
Thank you, the Lord God Almighty, holy holy holy you were and are and will be.</span></p>
