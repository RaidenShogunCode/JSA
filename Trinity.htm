45:6-7: A Davidic king, addressed as Elohim, is anointed by Elohim His Elohim.
This shows that Elohim is not, in itself, an indication of numerical plurality;
however, it also demonstrates that there are at least two Persons who can be
called Elohim, one of Whom is inferior to and anointed by the other.</span></p>

58:11: The Psalmist states that “there is a God Who judges [plural, lit. ‘they
judge’] the earth.” Whereas Elohim (plural) is occasionally used in reference
to lesser gods, it is always with a singular verb; here, (plural) Elohim is
used together with a plural verb, unprecedented in Hebrew except where multiple
persons are in view. This appears to be strong evidence for the plurality of
Persons within Elohim.</span></p>

who will be called “El-Gibbor” (lit. “God of Might”). The very same title is
applied in the next chapter to Yahweh, to Whom Israel is exhorted to return

61:1: Yahweh, Who is contextually the One speaking throughout the entirety of
this passage (see 60:22, 61:8), states that “the Spirit of Adonai Yahweh is
upon Me, for Yahweh has anointed Me.” The same Yahweh Who is speaking then goes
on to state that He will rejoice in Yahweh His God (v. 10)! The grammar appears
to indicate three Persons, all of Whom are called Yahweh directly: Yahweh Who
anoints and sends to Israel, Yahweh Who is anointed and sent to Israel, and the
Spirit of Adonai</span></p>

63:8-10: Yahweh saved Israel by the instrumentality of the Angel of His

Persons, all of Whom are identified with Yahweh (either in this passage or

appealing to the authority of God, as would be necessary when
altering/reversing a previous teaching of God, He appeals to His own authority:
“I say to you”! This proves that He Himself carries the authority of God, and

actual ontological identity as God. Furthermore, Jesus goes on to claim that
the purpose of judgment is “that all will honor the Son according as they honor
the Father” (vv. 22-23), indicating equality of worship between the Son and the
Father. The fact that the Son cannot do anything apart from the Father (vv. 19,
30) is not contrary to trinitarian theology, but actually expected by it, since
according to trinitarianism the unity of action between the Father and Son is
actually the foundation of all reality.</span></p>

8:24, 28: Jesus twice states emphatically that “I am He” (ego eimi), mirroring
two identical declarations from the book of Isaiah. First, He claims that “I am
He” (ego eimi) and that unless His audience believes this they will be dying
“in your sins” (en tais hamartiais humon), strongly paralleling Isaiah 43:24-25
in which Yahweh states that “you stood before Me in your sins [en tais
hamartiais humon]” but that “I am He, I am He [ego eimi ego eimi] Who blots out
your transgressions.” In the second statement, Jesus claims that “you will know
that I am He” (gnosesthehoti ego eimi) paralleling Isaiah 43:10 in which Yahweh
states that “you may know... that I am He.” These two, almost word-for-word,
quotes from the same chapter of Isaiah in such close proximity would certainly
not have been missed by Jesus’ Pharisaic audience</span></p>

8:58: After making such implicit claims to deity as noted in the previous note
above, Jesus goes on to say at the end of the chapter that “before Abraham
became, I am.” This parallels Exodus 3:14, it’s a straightforward claim that
Jesus existed before Abraham, coming immediately after a dialogue in which
Jesus implicitly claims to be far greater than even Abraham (something which
the Jews did not fail to pick up on). The Jews immediately pick up stones to
stone Jesus, showing that they viewed this as a strong claim to deity (and thus
‘blasphemy’). They were not merely stoning Him for His Messianic claims
(contrary to some unitarian arguments), because although He claimed explicitly
to be the Son of Man earlier in the chapter (v. 28), the Jews apparently did
not view this as warranting such extreme measures.</span></p>

else is either a thief or merely a “hired servant.” However, in the OT, the
only Shepherd of Israel is Yahweh Himself (Gen. 48:15; 49:24; Ps.23:1; 79:13;
80:1; 100:3; Isa. 40:11; Ezek. 34:31; many others). Unless Yahweh is being
degraded to merely a “hired servant” (impossible!) the claim to deity is
immediately evident: Jesus is not merely a hired servant of Yahweh, but He
Himself is Yahweh, the exclusive Shepherd of Israel</span></p>

Furthermore, the people of Israel are also the ‘sheep’ in His Father’s hand.
This is a reference back to Psalm 95:7, in which it is said that Israel are
“the people of [Yahweh’s] pasture and the sheep of His hand.” If they are the
sheep in the hand of both Jesus and His Father, the only conclusion is that
both Jesus and the Father are somehow Yahweh. This all leads up to the very

10:30: “I and the Father are one.” But in light of what He just finished
stating - that the Israelites are the ‘sheep in the hand’ of both He and the
Father -Jesus was already making a claim to ontological unity with His Father
as Yahweh (see the previous note above). Thus, by stating that “I and the
Father are one,” He was merely affirming that which His Pharisaic audience was
likely already thinking: “Yes, My Father and I are one; We are Yahweh.” This
also solves the apparent ‘problem’ of the many Shema-based passages which state
that “God is one” (e.g., Deut. 6:4; Mk. 12:29, 32; Rom. 3:30; Jas. 2:19). It is
indeed possible for God to be more than one Person, and yet still be One; for
between the Persons there is perfect unity of being and unity of action</span></p>

10:31-36: Jesus’ statement that “I and the Father are one” is the first time
that He explicitly makes Himself out to be God in the gospel of John; prior to
this, He had only indirectly indicated this by way of Old Testament references
(although His audience did not fail to pick up on it). The Jews, incensed by
this statement, immediately take up stones to stone Him “for blasphemy, because
you, being a man, make yourself God” (v. 33). In response, Jesus rebukes them:
“Is it not written in your Law, ‘I said, “You are gods”’?” (v. 34) Unitarians
often claim that Jesus is stating that He is merely a derivative and lesser
god, like the ones in Psalm 82. However, Jesus is actually using a typical
rabbinic rebuke technique in which a rabbi quotes the first part of a verse,
expecting the disciples to finish the quote and understand the rebuke. In the
original context of Psalm 82, the full quote is, “I have said, ‘You are gods,
and all of you are sons of the Most High; but you will die like men, and fall
like one of the princes.’ Arise, O Elohim, judge the earth!” Jesus is not
saying that he is a derivative</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:105%;color:white'>god;
rather, He is rebuking the Pharisees and saying that they will “die like men.”
In fact, in the context of the full quote, Jesus is putting Himself in the place
of Elohim, as Judge over all of the derivative gods (including the Pharisees).
This would make very little sense if Jesus were Himself one of the derivative
gods</span></p>

2:9: Paul states that “in Him [Jesus], all the fullness of the God-ness dwells
bodily.” This is a straightforward claim to the absolute deity of Christ.
First, whereas Eph. 3:19 states that believers may be filled with all the
fullness of God (theos), Col. 2:9 states that Jesus has all the fullness of
God-ness (theotes), that is, the state of being God. This is a small but very
important distinction. Second, whereas Eph. 3:19 states that believers must be
filled with the fullness of God (in the aorist subjunctive, describing a
one-time and uncertain event), Col. 2:9 states that all the fullness of
God-ness dwells bodily in Jesus (in the present indicative, describing a
continual, ongoing, and certain event). These two verses, though superficially
similar, are in fact very different and do not parallel one another. Whereas
believers must be filled with the fullness of God, all of the fullness of the
‘God-ness’ inherently dwells continually within Jesus. Furthermore, the next
verse states “...and in Christ you have been made full,” showing that any
‘fullness of God’ within believers is merely derivative to that of Christ.</span></p>

to the Son, “Your throne, O God, is to the age of the age, and a scepter of
righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and
hated lawlessness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of
joy beyond your companions.” Like in the original passage, this indicates two
individuals Who are called “God” (or “Elohim”), one of Whom is the Son, and the

Peter 1:1: Peter speaks of “the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus

same as elsewhere in the Petrine epistles where he refers to Jesus as “the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:105%;color:white'>Lord
and Savior” (2 Pet. 1:11; 2:20; 3:2; 3:18), and to the Father as “the God and

John 5:20: “We are in Him Who is TRUE, in His Son Jesus Christ; this One is the
TRUE God and eonian life.” Based on the grammar of this verse, John could be
referring to either the Father or Jesus (or even... both!) as “the TRUE God.”
However, contextual indications demonstrate virtually beyond a doubt that it
is, in fact, Jesus Who is being referred to in this way. This is because John
never refers to the Father as “eonian life,” but makes a habit of referring to
Jesus as “the Life” (Jn. 11:25; 14:6) and “the Truth” (Jn. 14:6) or even “the
TRUE” (Rev. 3:7)! Furthermore, at the start of this epistle and even earlier in
the same chapter, John calls Jesus the “eonian life” (1 Jn. 1:1-2; 5:11-12). So
then, it is very likely that John is referring to Jesus (or else, both the
Father and Jesus) as “the TRUE God.”</span></p>

4: Jude refers to Jesus as “our only Master and Lord Jesus Christ.” The title
“the Master/Owner” (ho despotes, lit. ‘the Despot’) emphasizes total authority,
and is typically applied to Yahweh alone, the One Who created the heavens and
the earth (Lk. 2:29; Acts 4:24; Rev. 6:10). If Jesus is “our only Master,” then
(unless Yahweh is somehow demoted to a lesser position than Jesus) Jesus must
be Yahweh, creator of heaven and earth.</span></p>

5: After stating that Jesus is avowedly our only Master and Lord, Jude goes on
to state “that Jesus/the Lord, after saving a people out of Egypt, then
destroyed those who did not believe.” [destruction of the flesh, they will be
saved eventually by belief in Christ]. The textual evidence is split fairly
evenly between the two readings “Jesus” and “the Lord,” although leaning
slightly toward “Jesus.” However, even if the original reading is “the Lord,”
Jude just stated that Jesus is “our only Lord”! This early Christian tradition
that Jesus is the One who led the exodus from Egypt parallels the Old Testament
teaching that it was ‘the Angel of the Presence’ Who saved Israel, and Who,
though being sent by Yahweh, nevertheless carries the name of Yahweh
(Exod.23:20-21, Isa. 63:8-10)</span></p>

25: “To the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power, and authority,
through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now, and for the ages, verily!”

Jesus Christ before all ages, which of course requires Jesus to have existed
before all ages. (See also 2 Tim. 1:9 which implies that Christ Jesus existed
“before times eonian.”)</span></p>

1:17-18: Jesus declares, “I am the First and the Last, and the Living One.”
Elsewhere in RevJohn, the statement that “I am the First and the Last” is
attributed to the One sitting on the throne, Who is unambiguously the Father
(Rev. 1:11). Tthe title of “the Living One” is absolutely unique to Yahweh
alone, the Living God in Whom is all life. This is the climax of the “Life”
statements throughout the Johannine literature (cf. Jn. 11:25; 14:6; 1 Jn.
1:1-2; 5:11-12; 5:20). Revelation 2:8: Jesus once again claims to be “the First
and the Last.” Revelation 2:23: Jesus declares that all of the churches will
come to know that “I am the One Who searches minds and hearts, and I will give
to each of you according to your works.” This brings together two frequent OT
statements about Yahweh’s role in judgment (for which see 1 Chron. 28:9; Ps.
