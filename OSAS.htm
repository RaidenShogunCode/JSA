= Once Saved Always Saved is true. (Scroll down for why Hard Determinsm is
true) When you are saved by belief in Jesus Christ with faith alone, then you are
permanently saved and cannot lose your salvation. Jesus Christ was killed,
buried and risen to pay for all our sins. You are born again, a new creation,
permanently clean of all sins, permanently counted as righteous. The Holy
Spirit, the Holy Ghost, who is God, is sealed on you and dwells in you
permanently. You are ChristÅfs sheep, kept safe in His hands. Known as Eternal
Security too. This is Assurance of Salvation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:105%;color:#ED7D31'>However,
on the subject of eternal security, his position was Calvinistic (once saved
always saved).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:105%;color:#ED7D31'>I'm
the kind of person who likes to have a sound and reasonable answer to all
questions. For example, I might find myself one day in a Baptist church which
may have handed me a brochure on the doctrine of eternal security, that is,
that once a person was &quot;saved&quot; or &quot;born again,&quot; they could
not lose their salvation; the gift of eternal life could not be revoked nor
lost even by turning away from God or denying Him. I would take the brochure to
perhaps the Assembly of God pastor or some other denomination which taught one
could lose their salvation. (This, by the way, is what the vast majority of
Christians are incorrectly taught). I would wrestle back and forth with the
various pastors until I felt I could see which group was right from a
Scriptural point of view. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:105%;color:#ED7D31'>Having
bounced back and forth between Calvinistic churches like Southern Baptist,
Presbyterian, Reformed, etc., which teach the eternal security of a believer
and Arminian type of churches, which comprise most of the rest of the
denominations, I became thoroughly convinced that the Doctrine of Eternal
Security was Scripturally correct. I cried out greatly to my heavenly Father
about this important doctrine and I believe He divinely gave me the assurance
the Doctrine of Eternal Security was correct. (I have since made an audio
teaching entitled <i>Saved to the Uttermost</i> which dealt with that subject.)
Taking that security away from a believer, I felt was putting them back under
some system of Law or works. Salvation, according to the Bible is <i>&quot;By
grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is a
gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.&quot;</i> (Ephesians
2:8,9) If the gift was not earned through works of doing good versus evil and
if this gift was life eternal, then it could never be lost or else it would not
be eternal. One cannot lose something that is eternal or else it becomes
temporary. Jesus promised a quality of life which would pass through all the
ages. After death was conquered He would bring us into a fellowship with the
Father which is described as the Father being &quot;all in all.&quot; (1 Cor.
15:28) (I am not going to get into the dozens of Scriptures found in the Bible
which give assurance to the believer that their life is completely secure in
Him, but if anyone wants a copy of the tape on the subject, I'll gladly send it
to them.)</span></p>

gives them that opportunity to believe, after all. And we know that God does
not change His mind. IÅfm a Hard Determinist personally, so when God chooses to
save a person, GodÅfs decision is permanent. He perseveres us, my viewpoint is
that Free Will does not exist, so we literally donÅft have the Free Will to lose
our salvation (I feel like that could easily become another debate though lol).
